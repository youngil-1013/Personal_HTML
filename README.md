# Personal_HTML

This repository was created for me to review HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascadingd Style Sheet) concepts. I followed the [Become a Web Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-web-developer?u=36758476) course from LinkedIn Learning to help me get started.

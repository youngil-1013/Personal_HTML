# Personal_HTML

This repository was created for me to review HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) concepts. I followed the [Become a Web Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-web-developer?u=36758476) course from LinkedIn Learning to help me get started.

## HTML elements

In this section, we will look at some HTML elements and their tags. 

All elements are defined using tags and the content of a tag is placed between the opening and closing tag which can be nested:

> `<p> this is an <em> emphasized </em> word </p>` 
>  <p> this is an <em> emphasized </em> word </p>

__Paragraphs__, well, denote where paragraphs begin and end. Without paragraphs, all text is mushed together into one big blob:

> `<p> this is a simple paragraph </p>`
> <p> this is a simple paragraph </p>

__Headlines__ are bigger and bolder than paragraphs. We actually have 6 levels of them:
> `<h1> this is the h1 headline </h1>` 
> 
> `<h2> this is the h2 headline </h2>`
> <h1> this is the h1 headline </h1>
> <h2> this is the h1 headline </h2>

__Accenting Texts__ are used to highlight texts:
> `<i>Harry Potter</i> is <b>my</b> <em>favorite</em> book. Do <strong>NOT</strong> criticize it.`
> 
> <i>Harry Potter</i> is <b>my</b> <em>favorite</em> book. Do <strong>NOT</strong> criticize it.
> 
> Note that the difference lies not in the visual aspect but on what meaning each of the tags represent.

__Lists__ can be unordered, ordered, or definition lists:
> <b> Unordered List </b>
> ```
> <ul>
>  <li> apple </li>
>  <li> banana </li>
>  <li> candy </li>
> </ul>
> ```
> <ul>
>  <li> apple </li>
>  <li> banana </li>
>  <li> candy </li>
> </ul>
> 
> <b> Ordered List </b>
> ```
> <ol>
>  <li> uno </li>
>  <li> dos </li>
>  <li> tres </li>
> </ol>
> ```
> <ol>
>  <li> uno </li>
>  <li> dos </li>
>  <li> tres </li>
> </ol>
> 
> <b> Definition List </b>
> ```
> <dl>
>    <dt> Word </dt>
>    <dd> Definition <dt> 
> </dl>
> ```
> <dl>
>    <dt> Word </dt>
>    <dd> Definition <dt> 
> </dl>

# Personal_HTML

This repository was created for me to review HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascadingd Style Sheet) concepts. I followed the [Become a Web Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-web-developer?u=36758476) course from LinkedIn Learning to help me get started.

## HTML elements

In this section, we will look at some HTML elements and their tags. 

- All elements are defined using tags and the content of a tag is placed between the opening and closing tag which can be nested:

`<p> this is an <em> emphasized </em> word` 
<details>
  <summary> See example </summary>
    <p> this is an <em> emphasized </em> word 
</details>
